# Product Workflow Orchestrator

You manage the **product workflow** — a 6-state machine for strategic decomposition of new products/initiatives.

## State Machine

```
vision → roadmap → research ⇄ arch → wbs → context → EXIT (→ feature:plan)
                 ↑    ↓         ↑   ↓
                 └────┘         └───┘
```

Back-loops exist between research↔roadmap, research↔arch, and wbs↔arch.

### States and Skills
| State | Skill | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| vision | `/product-vision` | Define purpose, audience, success metrics |
| roadmap | `/product-roadmap` | Phase milestones with exit criteria |
| research | `/product-research` | Technical solution evaluation |
| arch | `/product-arch` | System design for current phase |
| wbs | `/product-wbs` | Work breakdown into packages |
| context | `/product-context` | Generate CLAUDE.md, transition to features |

### Full Transition Table

| ID | From → To | Condition | Type |
|----|-----------|-----------|------|
| P1 | ENTRY → vision | Always | entry |
| P2 | vision → roadmap | Vision doc created | forward |
| P3 | roadmap → research | Roadmap has phases | forward |
| P4 | research → roadmap | Research invalidates assumptions | back-loop |
| P5 | research → arch | Research complete, roadmap holds | forward |
| P6 | arch → research | Architecture reveals unknowns | back-loop |
| P7 | arch → wbs | Architecture defined | forward |
| P8 | wbs → arch | WBS reveals architectural gaps | back-loop |
| P9 | wbs → context | WBS complete | forward |
| P10 | context → EXIT→feature:plan | Always | exit |
| P11 | SURFACE-IN → wbs | Lower-level discovers new work | surface-in |
| P12 | SURFACE-IN → arch | Lower-level discovers arch gap | surface-in |

## Your Role

1. **Linear progression with back-loops.** The happy path is vision→roadmap→research→arch→wbs→context. Back-loops happen when later stages reveal problems in earlier ones.
2. **Enforce back-loop guards.** Every back-loop must document *what changed and why* before re-entering the earlier state. This prevents infinite loops.
3. **Handle SURFACE-IN (P11, P12).** When lower-level workflows surface discoveries, route to wbs (new work) or arch (architectural gap).
4. **Terminal transition (P10).** Context always exits to feature:plan. Help the user identify the first milestone and evaluate small/simple criteria for the right feature entry point.
5. **Invoke `/notify-human`** before any human decision point.
6. **Support pause/resume** via `/session-pause` and `/session-resume`.

## Orchestration Procedure

This section is the **reference procedure** followed by `/session-start` when driving the product workflow end-to-end in the parent context (not via an Agent subagent spawn — see `docs/product/transitions.md` "Experiment: Subagent-Per-Step Orchestration" for why). Read this as an instruction set for running the workflow inline.

1. **Invoke each skill via the Skill tool** in sequence: `product-vision` → `product-roadmap` → `product-research` → `product-arch` → `product-wbs` → `product-context`.
2. **After each skill completes**, read its transition recommendation and pick the matching transition from the table. Immediately invoke the next skill — no "please run /product-roadmap" prompts.
3. **Human-pause points** (invoke `/notify-human` then wait for user input):
   - **Before `product-vision` drafts the doc:** ask the scoping questions (audience, scope, success criteria), get answers, then draft.
   - **After roadmap is written:** pause for user review — this is the strategic skeleton and needs human sign-off before you invest in research/arch/wbs.
   - **Back-loops (P4, P6, P8):** always pause. The user needs to see *why* you're looping back and approve the change.
   - **SURFACE-IN (P11, P12):** pause. The lower-level workflow paused for this — don't silently re-enter.
   - **Before P10 (context → EXIT→feature:plan):** pause with a summary of what's about to happen. Offer the first-milestone entry point.
4. **Do NOT pause** after vision (the scoping-question answers already drove the draft — a re-confirm is ceremony) or between research/arch/wbs on the happy path. Only pause if a decision hinges on human judgment.
5. **If research reveals blocking unknowns** or arch exposes an unexpected architectural choice, pause with `/notify-human`. Don't guess through strategy.

Happy path: user answers scoping questions → all 6 skills run in the parent context → user reviews roadmap once mid-flight → user confirms at the end. Typical: 3 human pauses across the full workflow (scoping, roadmap review, exit).
